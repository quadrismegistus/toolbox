  <p>Prosodic is a a metrical-phonological parser written in Python. Currently, it can parse English and Finnish text, but adding additional languages is easy with a pronunciation dictionary or a custom python function. PROSODIC was built by <a href="https://github.com/quadrismegistus">Ryan Heuser</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jsfalk">Josh Falk</a>, and <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/%7Eanttila/" rel="nofollow">Arto Anttila</a>, beginning in the summer of 2010. Josh also maintains <a href="https://github.com/jsfalk/prosodic1b">another repository</a>, in which he has rewritten the part of this project that does phonetic transcription for English and Finnish. <a href="https://github.com/sleepinyourhat">Sam Bowman</a> has contributed to the codebase as well, adding several new metrical constraints.</p>

  <p>Prosodic does two main things. First, it tokenizes text into words, and then converts each word into its stressed, syllabified, phonetic transcription. Second, if desired, it finds the best available metrical parse for each line of text. In the style of Optimality Theory, (almost) all logically possibile parses are attempted, but the best parses are those that least violate a set of user-defined constraints. The default metrical constraints are those proposed by Kiparsky and Hanson in their paper "A Parametric Theory of Poetic Meter" (<i>Language</i>, 1996).</p>
